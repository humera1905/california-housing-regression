# California Housing Analysis

**Repository name suggestion:** `california-housing-analysis`  
**Short description:** Exploratory data analysis and regression modeling to predict California housing prices using the `fetch_california_housing` dataset from scikit-learn.

## Overview

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of the California Housing dataset. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand distributions, correlations, and geographic patterns.
- Feature engineering to derive new predictors.
- Preprocessing with scaling and train/test splitting.
- Regression modeling using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Evaluation of model performance with MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics.
- Interpretation of the linear model via coefficients.
